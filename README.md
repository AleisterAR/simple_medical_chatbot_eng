# simple_medical_chatbot_eng
Currently diving into NLP and my interest piqued, so here I am building a chatbot. The original source code and the dataset used will be in the markdown file.  More details will be explained there.  Apart from the direct source code, I'll be trying to improve the model's accuracy and changing the different models, experimenting. Source code link is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vafaknm/chatbot-for-mental-health-analysis) and the dataset is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvis23/mental-health-conversational-data).
